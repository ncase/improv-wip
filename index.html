<p>a tool to make tools to make <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">explorable explanations</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Let's say you have a model of a complex system.
And you want others to be able to play around with it, explore the system, change its rules, maybe even create their <em>own</em> models with it! Well, that's an incredibly specific goal to have, but hey, you're in luck.</p>

<p><strong>Improv</strong> lets you write words normally like this...</p>

<pre><code>A "boid" is like a bird, but worse.
Let's make a flock of {NUMBER count: min=0,max=100} boids,
and paint 'em all {CHOOSE color: black, red, blue, random colors}!
</code></pre>

<p>...which will get you something like this!</p>

</iframe>

<p>But wait, there's more!
Besides sliding numbers and selecting from dropdowns,
Improv also has the ability to let your readers "re-program" the system itself, without having to touch the messy code itself, without fear of breaking everything.</p>

<p>Here's how. Again, you start with regular writing:</p>

<pre><code>Let's make a flock of {NUMBER count: min=0,max=100} boids,
and paint 'em all {CHOOSE color: black, red, blue, random colors}!

Also, every "tick", each boid does this:
{ACTIONS actions}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>{ACTIONS actions}</code> at the end. That's where your reader will get to live-edit the behavior of the system! Somewhere else, you have to define what "actions" an object in your system can do, and what parameters can be changed. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>Improv.actions.move = {
    short: "Move forward...",
    editor: "Move forward by {NUMBER amount: min=0,max=50} pixels",
    act: function(boid,options){
        // code to make the boid move by [options.amount] pixels
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another one:</p>

<pre><code>Improv.actions.if_close = {
    short: "If close to...",
    editor: "If I'm within {NUMBER radius: min=0,max=500} pixels of "+
             "{CHOOSE target: the mouse, another boid}, then..."+
             "{ACTIONS actions}",
    act: function(boid,options){
        // code using options.radius, options.target &amp; options.actions
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Notice <code>{ACTIONS actions}</code> is there <em>again.</em>
This lets your reader make sub-actions for that action! Like my mama always said, recursion is its own reward.
Finally, all that will give you something like this:</p>

<iframe src="demos/boids/boids2.html" class="feature" width="960" height="640">
</iframe>

<p>Now you can make all kinds of flocks! But while boids are cool, <del>they aren't very useful.</del> (actually, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a> are often used in game AI, movie CGI, and swarm robotics. If I extended this demo a bit more, maybe I could create a pretty useful, designer-friendly boid "scripting" tool???)</p>

<p>Luckily, because Improv is <em>independent</em> of the kind of model you give it, both authors and readers can use Improv to live-edit all kinds of things! Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation:</strong> agent-based models, cellular automata, complex networks, markov chains, stocks and flows, mathematical models</li>
<li><strong>Journalism:</strong> interactive data visualizations</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> learning about systems, learning programming (as a way of thinking, not rote-memorizing syntax)</li>
<li><strong>Misc Cool Stuff:</strong> design tools for videogames, procedural art</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever it is, I'm excited to see what <em>you</em> can make with Improv. This tool, that makes tools, that make explorable explanations... that can make us into more active learners, more critical thinkers, better citizens of our shared world.</p>

<hr />

<h2>TO DO:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Actually make tools with this.</strong>  <br/>
I mean, that's the whole reason I made this, because it was getting tedious re-implementing the same "live editing" features over and over again. (I'm personally interested in using Improv to make a tool to simulate complex networks &amp; agent-based models)</li>
<li><strong>Support for variables &amp; objects.</strong> <br/>
Once Improv can do variables, <em>then</em> it'll have real power. I'm thinking specifically of Complex Adaptive Systems â€“ CAS need agents with varying properties, hence, it needs variables.</li>
<li><strong>More Widgets.</strong>  <br/>
Right now, the only "Widgets" are NUMBER, CHOOSE, and ACTIONS. It could use more. What about free-form text? What about graphical widgets, like a bell-curve-manipulator to choose your own probability distribution? Or what about <em>output</em> widgets, like graphs to show the state of the system?</li>
</ul>
